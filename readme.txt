* Windows 8 and 8.1 Live Tiles in all sizes

All of the above can be supported with a single image supplied by you to the plugin and all the required formats will then be generated by OS Integration.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= Some image sizes are not generating? =

You must provide an image larger than 450x450 (or 450x281 for the wide image).  If a smaller image is supplied it the code will not resize them to a larger format.

= What libraries are required? =

The WordPress image editor is used to resize the images, which supports both GD and Image Magic.

= I don't have GD but I do have Image Magic, but the Apple Icons are broken, what's wrong? =

The Image Magic code is still in development and may not function at this time.
